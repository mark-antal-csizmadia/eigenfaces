# eigenfaces
Eigenfaces exercise.

# Get it running by following the steps below:
1. Make sure you have Anaconda and Git installed on your machine.
2. Go to your desired directory, open your terminal of choice and clone the directory to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/mark-antal-csizmadia/eigenfaces.git
4. Open the Anaconda prompt in the directory where the files have been clones, and recreate the eigenfaces_env virtual environment: conda env create -f eigenfaces_env.yml
6. Still in the Anaconda prompt, make sure that the eigenfaces_env virtual environment has been created: conda info --envs
7. Still in the Anaconda prompt, make the eigenfaces_env virtual environment available for 
Jupyter Notebook as a kernel: python -m ipykernel install --user --name eigenfaces_env --display-name "Python (eigenfaces_env)"
8. Still in the Anaconda prompt, open up the eigenfaces.ipynb: jupyter notebook eigenfaces.ipynb
9. Make sure that the kernel is set to the eigenfaces_env kernel.
10. Happy playing!
